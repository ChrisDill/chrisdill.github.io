This is my first post testing everything is working as it should be. This is currently a work in progress so things will change alot. :)

Im starting this to give me a place to improve my writing skills and share some of my ideas on things. I enjoy reading other blog posts so I decided to give it a go for myself.

I am currently collaborating on a sci-fi style game so I will start with writing a bit about that and see how it goes. This is all new to me so it will take a while to get used to.

Thats all for now. Any feedback is welcome.
