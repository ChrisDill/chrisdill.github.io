title: Instanced rendering in raylib
author: Chris Dill
---

This is one of my side projects. A set of instancing examples using raylib. I learned about instancing from
[learnopengl](https://learnopengl.com) and it looked like a fun way to get back into graphics programming.

The goal of this project is to combine the power of instancing with the ease of use of raylib to make the feature more
accessible. It also makes for some cool screenshots to showcase just ***how much stuff*** you can draw to the screen at
60fps.

This post will be updated with more screenshots as the project improves.

You can find the source for the project [here](https://github.com/ChrisDill/raylib-instancing).
