The more I try to force myself to think of a good idea the more frustrating it is when nothing seems good. Every time I think I might have something it doesn't take long to think of all the flaws.

There is a common saying that you are your own worse critic. While I could actually have a good idea, in the moment I am relying on my initial jugdement on if I should keep it. I have found it helps to practice writing down my ideas despite what I think of it in the moment and then come back to the list of ideas every so often.

- Think it has been done before. Write it down.

- Think it is silly or impractical. Write it down.

- Think it is not good enough. Write it down.

I have found I don't actively think about the idea once I write it down so when I come back to it later it gives me a new perspective on it. Looking through the list of ideas also helps inspire new thoughts and ideas I would not of had if I considered a idea on its own.

The hardest part is getting into the habit of writing things down in the first place. I write my ideas in markdown files and make sure I can access them quickly which helps but it is still easy to discard a idea in the moment.

Anyway, this post is mostly a reminder to myself to keep at it. I want to improve at writing and this is something I found helpful.
