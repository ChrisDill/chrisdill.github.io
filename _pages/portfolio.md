## Sirius game

I am collaboratively working on a game in my spare time. It is a topdown sci-fi shooter inspired by games such as FTL - Faster than light and Heat Signature.

## Raylib-cs

Made C# bindings for [raylib](https://www.raylib.com) which is a simple and easy to use library for video games programming. I wanted to see if I could use it with C# for game development. Improved my project management skills and gained experience with using git for larger projects.

## Raylib-instancing

Instancing experiments using raylib to have some fun with graphics programming. I wanted to see if was possible
in raylib and if so how flexible/powerful it could be. Over time raylib has added features that help improve support
for this making the examples easier to understand for beginners while also being flexible for advanced use cases.

## Mech shooter

College project as part of a team. Gave myself a goal to make a prototype in Unreal for a first-person shooter but with mechs. Used the blueprint system for the logic and learned a bit about Unreal style c++. End result had 2 player controlled mechs in a level that could fight each other across a network.
